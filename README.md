## The Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in the US, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, and more. It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn in the late 1950s.

The algorithm is used to validate the Israeli ID number. The ID number is a 9 digit number, the last digit is a check digit. The check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.

## Why was this project started

This repository was created by Itamar Itzhaki as a resource to help developers implement the Luhn algorithm to check and validate Israeli IDs in different programming languages. It currently includes examples in JavaScript, Go, Java, C, C++, Ruby, Swift, and more.
